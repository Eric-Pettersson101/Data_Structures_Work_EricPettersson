Data Structures Coursework, CU Boulder

This repository contains my coursework from the Data Structures course at CU Boulder. The contents are organized by project folders, each containing relevant PDFs and README files alongside the corresponding C++ code. The course projects are particularly noteworthy and are worth exploring.

One highlight of my coursework is the task I created to run Valgrind on my course project, which I am particularly proud of. At the beginning of this course, I had no prior experience with C++ or using VS Code. By the end of the course, I gained a decent familiarity with VS Code and have become moderately skilled in C++.
